I am in my 3rd year in High School - Grade 9. I chose to spend my 4 years of high school life in Ateneo de Naga University Junior High School. 🏫 Let's talk about my experiences as a student. 👧

*Being a student is one of the most meaningful things we can be in life, I suppose. However, it can also be a phase wherein we may encounter the most tragic moments in our life. But take this tip from me, we can never live the fullest of our high school years if we don't try. Here, we may meet the people who will stay with us up until we grow up, or the people who will be with us just temporarily to teach us the things we need to learn about life, but we shall always learn to cherish them. In short, being in highschool is both a magic and a fearful moment; but we shall never be afraid.*
